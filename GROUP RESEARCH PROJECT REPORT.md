## Introduction


#### NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LONGER WORKING HOURS

Extended working hours can harm employees' physical and mental health, disrupt their work-life balance, and raise safety concerns, ultimately reducing job satisfaction. Research highlights how reduced sleep and heightened stress from longer hours hinder work performance and personal life enjoyment, diminishing overall satisfaction. Working over 48 hours a week, as Åkerstedt notes, is linked to significant declines in productivity and contentment(Åkerstedt. 2002).

Initially, some employees may see extended hours as beneficial for career growth or higher earnings. However, studies reveal that the long-term effects, including stress and work-family conflicts, outweigh these benefits, leading to higher turnover intentions. Flexible working hours may offer a temporary boost for employees valuing autonomy, but the negative impact tends to persist.

Models like Karasek’s Job Demand-Control framework explain how high demands with little control exacerbate job strain and dissatisfaction, fueling thoughts of quitting. Organizational support and job autonomy can mitigate these impacts, but prolonged overtime often results in decreased life satisfaction and commitment, as shown by (Ford et al. 2011).


## Methodology

### Questionnaire Framework
The survey for this study was conducted online using Google Forms. It featured a mix of multiple-choice, Linear scale, and yes/no questions designed to explore the effects of long work hours. Questions focused on key topics like job stress, satisfaction, and whether employees were considering a career change. With 17 thoughtfully crafted questions, the survey was shared with 45 participants. The main goal was to understand how extended work hours influence employees' well-being and work behaviors.

### Sampling Method
Participants were carefully selected from employees working in various companies across the European Union. This included individuals holding different roles and responsibilities within their organizations. By targeting such a diverse group, we aimed to capture a wide range of perspectives and experiences.

### Data Analysis
The collected data were analyzed using statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and averaging. First, we looked at correlations to uncover detailed relationships between variables. Then, averages were used to paint a bigger picture and provide clearer insights. This approach helped us better understand the connection between long work hours, job stress, and employees’ decisions about staying or leaving their jobs.

### Hypothesis Testing
We tested two hypotheses in this study. The first looked at whether extended work hours lead to negative employee perceptions (H1) or have no impact. (H2) The second examined if job stress affects an employee’s willingness to leave their job. Using statistical analysis, we uncovered key patterns and relationships, offering a solid basis for our conclusions.

## Conclusion
This study sheds light on the impact of extended working hours on employees' well-being, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. The findings reveal that excessive work demands, increased stress, and a lack of work-life balance significantly reduce productivity and employee commitment over time. While flexible working arrangements can provide short-term benefits for those valuing autonomy, the long-term effects often lead to work-family conflicts and health issues.

For businesses, these insights highlight the importance of creating a sustainable work culture. Offering balanced workloads and flexible, quality-focused schedules tailored to employee needs can improve job satisfaction and retention while boosting productivity. Encouraging healthier work practices benefits not just employees but the organization as a whole.

From a research perspective, this study emphasizes the value of exploring how extended work hours affect people in different demographic and cultural settings. Long-term studies can provide a clearer picture of how work patterns evolve over time. Additionally, examining industry-specific impacts and comparing on-site, remote, and hybrid work models can help identify strategies for fostering employee well-being and efficiency.
