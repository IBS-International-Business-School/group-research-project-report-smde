## Introduction
, diminished work-life balance, and safety concerns due to extended working hours negatively impact job satisfaction (Sparks et al., 1997; Geurts & Demerouti, 2003). Reduced sleep and increased stress impair employees' ability to work effectively and enjoy personal life, leading to decreased job satisfaction (Sturges & Guest, 2004). Ã…kerstedt (2002) found that working more than 48 hours per week is significantly associated with reduced satisfaction and productivity at work.ddqwdqwd
While some employees may initially perceive extended hours as beneficial for earnings or career growth (Kelliher & Anderson, 2010; Kostiuk, 1990), long-term effects tend to reduce job satisfaction. Kelliher and Anderson (2010) discussed how flexible working hours, even if extended, can improve job satisfaction for those who value autonomy over work-life balance. However, the sustaining impact appears negative, ultimately leading to higher turnover intentions.
 working hours contribute to increased turnover intentions due to work-life balance dissatisfaction and stress (Mitchell et al., 2001; Amstad et al., 2011). The Job Demand-Control model (Karasek, 1979) suggests that excessive demands with low control lead to job strain, inversely related to job satisfaction and increasing turnover intentions. Dierdorff (2008) found that overtime leads to increased turnover because it results in work-family conflict. Sparks et al. (1997) reported that work-related stress is significantly higher among employees who work longer hours, predicting a higher likelihood of quitting.
