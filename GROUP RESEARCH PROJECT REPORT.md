## Introduction
Work has always been fundamental to human existence, serving as the cornerstone of survival and progress. Historically, the length and intensity of work were dictated by necessity and societal norms rather than regulated hours. The Industrial Revolution introduced regulated schedules and the concept of an 8-hour workday, now a modern employment standard. However, despite advancements, demands for extended work hours persist due to a fast-paced economy, globalization, fierce competition, and the quest for productivity, leading employees to work beyond scheduled hours.
The implications of extended working hours on employee well-being, satisfaction, and turnover intentions have been extensively researched. Some employees view overtime as an opportunity for increased earnings or as a testament to their commitment and dedication. Others perceive it as a burden encroaching on personal time, leading to physical and psychological stress (Dettmers, 2016). These factors can negatively affect attitudes toward their jobs and organizations, resulting in decreased job satisfaction and increased turnover intentions. High employee turnover can harm businesses through increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and operational disruptions. However, the direct correlation between overtime, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions remains a topic of debate.
This thesis aims to explore how overtime and extended working hours influence employee job satisfaction and turnover intentions. Adopting a quantitative approach and employing a questionnaire as the primary research instrument, the study will gather empirical data reflecting a broad spectrum of employee experiences. This will facilitate a nuanced analysis of the overtime-work phenomenon. Through this research, the thesis seeks to contribute a fresh perspective to the discourse on work-life balance, employee retention, and organizational management.
