## Methodology

### Questionnaire Framework
The survey for this study was conducted online using Google Forms. It featured a mix of multiple-choice, Linear scale, and yes/no questions designed to explore the effects of long work hours. Questions focused on key topics like job stress, satisfaction, and whether employees were considering a career change. With 17 thoughtfully crafted questions, the survey was shared with 45 participants. The main goal was to understand how extended work hours influence employees' well-being and work behaviors.

### Sampling Method
Participants were carefully selected from employees working in various companies across the European Union. This included individuals holding different roles and responsibilities within their organizations. By targeting such a diverse group, we aimed to capture a wide range of perspectives and experiences.

### Data Analysis
The collected data were analyzed using statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and averaging. First, we looked at correlations to uncover detailed relationships between variables. Then, averages were used to paint a bigger picture and provide clearer insights. This approach helped us better understand the connection between long work hours, job stress, and employees’ decisions about staying or leaving their jobs.

### Hypothesis Testing
We tested two hypotheses in this study. The first looked at whether extended work hours lead to negative employee perceptions (H1) or have no impact. (H2) The second examined if job stress affects an employee’s willingness to leave their job. Using statistical analysis, we uncovered key patterns and relationships, offering a solid basis for our conclusions.
