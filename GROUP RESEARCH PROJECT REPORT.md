## Introduction

Work has always been a fundamental part of human development, evolving alongside societal, economic, and technological advancements. Historically, the length and nature of work were dictated by survival needs and cultural practices, with little regulation or structure. The Industrial Revolution marked a significant turning point by introducing standardized work hours, eventually leading to the widely adopted 8-hour workday. However, despite these regulations, modern economies have increasingly embraced extended working hours. The drive for longer workdays is fueled by globalization, technological progress, and the constant pursuit of higher productivity in a highly competitive market.

While extended working hours may present certain challenges, they also offer several positive outcomes for both employees and organizations.

#### POSITIVE EFFECT OF LONGER WORKING HOURS

One of the most apparent benefits of working longer hours is the potential for increased earnings. Overtime pay provides employees with an opportunity to enhance their financial well-being, offering greater financial security and improved quality of life. This additional income can help employees meet personal financial goals, such as saving for future expenses, paying off debts, or improving their standard of living (Dettmers, 2016).

Beyond financial incentives, extended working hours can contribute to career growth and professional development. Employees who consistently invest extra time in their work often stand out for their commitment, reliability, and dedication. This demonstration of a strong work ethic can lead to increased recognition from supervisors, greater responsibilities, and opportunities for promotions and salary advancements. Moreover, working additional hours allows employees to gain hands-on experience with complex tasks, expand their skill set, and develop expertise in their roles, making them more competitive in their field (Dettmers, 2016).
For organizations, extended working hours can lead to significant operational advantages. Increased employee availability helps businesses manage fluctuating workloads, meet critical deadlines, and maintain a high level of productivity. This is especially important during peak periods or when project timelines are tight. Additionally, organizations benefit from the continuity and efficiency that overtime work provides, as employees help ensure that essential tasks are completed without delay.

Finally, working longer hours can foster a sense of accomplishment and personal fulfillment. Employees who successfully complete challenging tasks or contribute to important projects often experience greater job satisfaction and a stronger connection to their organization’s mission and goals (Dettmers, 2016).

#### NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LONGER WORKING HOURS

Extended working hours can harm employees' physical and mental health, disrupt their work-life balance, and raise safety concerns, ultimately reducing job satisfaction. Research highlights how reduced sleep and heightened stress from longer hours hinder work performance and personal life enjoyment, diminishing overall satisfaction. Working over 48 hours a week, as Åkerstedt notes, is linked to significant declines in productivity and contentment(Åkerstedt. 2002).

Initially, some employees may see extended hours as beneficial for career growth or higher earnings. However, studies reveal that the long-term effects, including stress and work-family conflicts, outweigh these benefits, leading to higher turnover intentions. Flexible working hours may offer a temporary boost for employees valuing autonomy, but the negative impact tends to persist.

Models like Karasek’s Job Demand-Control framework explain how high demands with little control exacerbate job strain and dissatisfaction, fueling thoughts of quitting. Organizational support and job autonomy can mitigate these impacts, but prolonged overtime often results in decreased life satisfaction and commitment, as shown by (Ford et al. 2011).


## Methodology

### Questionnaire Framework
The survey for this study was conducted online using Google Forms. It featured a mix of multiple-choice, Linear scale, and yes/no questions designed to explore the effects of long work hours. Questions focused on key topics like job stress, satisfaction, and whether employees were considering a career change. With 17 thoughtfully crafted questions, the survey was shared with 45 participants. The main goal was to understand how extended work hours influence employees' well-being and work behaviors.

### Sampling Method
Participants were carefully selected from employees working in various companies across the European Union. This included individuals holding different roles and responsibilities within their organizations. By targeting such a diverse group, we aimed to capture a wide range of perspectives and experiences.

### Data Analysis
The collected data were analyzed using statistical techniques such as correlation analysis and averaging. First, we looked at correlations to uncover detailed relationships between variables. Then, averages were used to paint a bigger picture and provide clearer insights. This approach helped us better understand the connection between long work hours, job stress, and employees’ decisions about staying or leaving their jobs.

### Hypothesis Testing
We tested two hypotheses in this study. The first looked at whether extended work hours lead to negative employee perceptions (H1) or have no impact. (H2) The second examined if job stress affects an employee’s willingness to leave their job. Using statistical analysis, we uncovered key patterns and relationships, offering a solid basis for our conclusions.


## Results

#### Descriptive Statistics on Job Satisfaction
We began by analyzing job satisfaction levels among respondents. The data revealed that the majority of respondents reported low to moderate job satisfaction:

A significant percentage of respondents rated their job satisfaction at level 3 (neutral) or below, indicating dissatisfaction or indifference towards their work.
Only a small fraction of respondents reported higher satisfaction levels, suggesting systemic dissatisfaction in the workplace.
To visualize this, we included a bar chart showing the distribution of job satisfaction levels across the respondent pool. This chart clearly illustrates the predominance of dissatisfaction among employees.
#### Job Satisfaction and Overtime Frequency
We examined the relationship between job satisfaction and overtime frequency to explore the impact of extended working hours. Our calculations revealed a negative correlation between these two variables:

![image](https://github.com/IBS-International-Business-School/group-research-project-report-smde/blob/main/Pic_W_Hours.png?raw=true)

Observation: As the frequency of overtime increases, job satisfaction decreases.
Implication: Employees who worked overtime more often tended to report lower job satisfaction levels. This suggests that extended working hours adversely affect employees' perception of their jobs.
#### Stress and Fatigue
To identify potential reasons for low job satisfaction, we analyzed the correlation between overtime frequency and stress or fatigue levels. The results showed:

High Stress Levels Among Frequent Overtime Workers: Respondents who worked overtime frequently reported significantly higher levels of stress and fatigue.
Negative Correlation with Job Satisfaction: Those experiencing higher stress due to overtime were also more likely to report lower job satisfaction levels.

#### Turnover
When respondents were asked if they would consider leaving their company if they were dissatisfied with their work, the majority provided a positive response. This indicates that dissatisfaction with their current work environment strongly influences employees' intentions to seek employment elsewhere. However, when the question was reframed to assess whether employees would actually leave their company due to dissatisfaction without having another job opportunity available, the responses were notably different. The majority of participants provided a negative response, suggesting that despite dissatisfaction, practical considerations such as job security and financial stability often outweigh the desire to leave. This highlights a common dilemma for employees: the tension between job dissatisfaction and the necessity to maintain a steady income.

## Discussion
By analyzing survey responses and conducting statistical analyses, the results provide clear insights into the perceptions of employees regarding long working hours and their impact on job satisfaction and turnover intentions.

**H1: Most employees see longer work hours as adverse rather than beneficial**
The findings strongly support the hypothesis that most employees perceive longer work hours as adverse. The majority of respondents reported high levels of stress and fatigue due to extended working hours. This trend was particularly evident among those who frequently worked overtime, with a clear correlation between increased overtime frequency and higher stress levels.
Additionally, when asked about the impact of extended working hours, a significant proportion of respondents indicated negative effects on their personal and family life. This aligns with prior research emphasizing that long working hours can disrupt work-life balance, leading to dissatisfaction and burnout.
Interestingly, even though financial incentives were offered for overtime, they were only moderately influential in motivating employees to work extra hours. Respondents who worked overtime regularly did not perceive substantial career advancement benefits from their efforts, further reinforcing the view that extended working hours are more detrimental than beneficial.

**Recommendations for Organizations:**
Reevaluate Overtime Policies: Limit mandatory overtime and encourage work-life balance by implementing flexible work schedules.
Enhance Stress Management Programs: Offer wellness initiatives such as counseling services, fitness programs, or stress management workshops to support employee well-being.
Recognize and Reward Productivity: Shift focus from time spent at work to outcomes and efficiency. Recognize employees for achieving results within standard working hours.
Promote Clear Career Advancement Opportunities: Ensure employees understand how their efforts, including overtime, contribute to their career growth.

**H2: Due to work stress and dissatisfaction, employees would consider leaving the job**
The data also supports the hypothesis that work stress and dissatisfaction significantly influence turnover intentions. A majority of respondents indicated that dissatisfaction with their current work environment could motivate them to leave their company. This finding underscores the critical role of job satisfaction and well-being in retaining employees.
However, when respondents were asked if they would leave their company without another job opportunity available, the results were markedly different. Most participants expressed reluctance to take such a step, citing practical constraints such as job security and financial obligations. This highlights a disconnect between turnover intentions and actual turnover behavior, which is often moderated by external factors.
High levels of stress and fatigue, driven by extended working hours, further exacerbate dissatisfaction and increase turnover intentions. Employees who frequently experience stress due to overtime reported the lowest levels of job satisfaction, reinforcing the idea that dissatisfaction and stress are significant predictors of turnover intentions.

**Recommendations for Organizations:**
Foster a Positive Work Environment: Address root causes of dissatisfaction such as poor management, lack of recognition, or insufficient growth opportunities.
Improve Communication Channels: Provide employees with platforms to voice their concerns and ensure management acts on feedback.
Introduce Career Development Programs: Create clear pathways for internal mobility, skill development, and leadership training to retain talent.
Offer Competitive Compensation and Benefits: Provide benefits that align with employees’ needs, such as health insurance, retirement plans, and performance-based bonuses.


## Conclusion

This study sheds light on the impact of extended working hours on employees' well-being, job satisfaction, and turnover intentions. The findings reveal that excessive work demands, increased stress, and a lack of work-life balance significantly reduce productivity and employee commitment over time. While flexible working arrangements can provide short-term benefits for those valuing autonomy, the long-term effects often lead to work-family conflicts and health issues.

For businesses, these insights highlight the importance of creating a sustainable work culture. Offering balanced workloads and flexible, quality-focused schedules tailored to employee needs can improve job satisfaction and retention while boosting productivity. Encouraging healthier work practices benefits not just employees but the organization as a whole.

From a research perspective, this study emphasizes the value of exploring how extended work hours affect people in different demographic and cultural settings. Long-term studies can provide a clearer picture of how work patterns evolve over time. Additionally, examining industry-specific impacts and comparing on-site, remote, and hybrid work models can help identify strategies for fostering employee well-being and efficiency.
